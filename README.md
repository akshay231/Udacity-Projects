# Udacity-Projects
Responsive
In this project - I have set up chrome developer tools for responsive web design. My focus on the future projects will be to convert non-responsive web page to responsive page using these tools.
The quiz given by Udacity is : http://udacity.github.io/RWDF-samples/quizzes/custom-device-quiz.html
and the instructions are: 
Using the New Device Emulation Interface
The Device Emulation interface changed a bit with the newer version of Chrome Dev Tools. Here are the instructions for emulating the required device characteristics in the new UI:
1.	Select Edit from the Responsive drop-down menu.
2.	Select Add custom device.
3.	Give the device a unique name in the Device name field.
4.	Fill in the fields for Width, Height, Device pixel ratio and User agent string.
5.	Select Add.
6.	Select the newly added device from the Responsive drop-down menu.
7.	Change the Zoom level to 100%.
8.	Select and hold down on the reload icon until the context menu appears and select Clear Cache and Hard Reload.
